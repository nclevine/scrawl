using two canvases makes sense:
from sketch repo:
//two paper canvases, one for drawing on, one for displaying drawn elements
//for performance reason separate canvases is better - also, I think helps with reactivity

To Do:

- make drawing reactive
	- create saving/updating mechanism

Brainstorm:
	

- add friend structure
- add complexity to drawing, including tools
